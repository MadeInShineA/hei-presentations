### What are Support Vector Machines?

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are powerful supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. The core idea is to find the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes by maximizing the margin between them.

- **Maximum-margin classifier**: Finds the decision boundary that maintains the largest possible distance from the nearest training points
- **Support vectors**: Data points closest to the decision boundary that define the position of the hyperplane
- **Versatile**: Can be extended to non-linear problems using kernel functions

### How SVMs Work

SVMs follow a systematic approach to classification:

1. **Data preparation** üìä: Preparing training data with features and labels
2. **Hyperplane identification** üîç: Finding the optimal separating hyperplane
3. **Margin maximization** üìà: Creating the largest possible gap between classes
4. **Support vector selection** üéØ: Identifying the critical data points that define the boundary
5. **Classification** üß†: Using the trained model to predict new data points

### Linear vs. Non-linear Classification

- **Linear SVM**: Works well when classes are linearly separable
- **Non-linear SVM**: Uses kernel trick to handle complex, non-linear decision boundaries

#### Example

If we have a dataset with two classes and want to classify new points:

```
Class A: (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 2)
Class B: (6, 8), (7, 7), (5, 9)

SVM finds the optimal separating line that maximizes distance to nearest points from both classes.

### Linear SVM - Hard Margin

For linearly separable data, the SVM optimization problem can be expressed as:

Minimize: $\frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{w}||^2$

Subject to: $y_i(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} + b) \geq 1$ for all $i$

Where:

- $\mathbf{w}$ is the weight vector perpendicular to the hyperplane
- $b$ is the bias term
- $(\mathbf{x_i}, y_i)$ are the training data points with labels $y_i \in \{-1, +1\}$

### Soft Margin SVM

For non-separable data, we introduce slack variables $\xi_i$:

Minimize: $\frac{1}{2}||\mathbf{w}||^2 + C\sum_{i=1}^{n} \xi_i$

Subject to: $y_i(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x_i} + b) \geq 1 - \xi_i$ and $\xi_i \geq 0$

Where $C$ controls the trade-off between maximizing margin and minimizing classification error.

### Support Vectors

- **Definition**: The data points that lie closest to the decision boundary
- **Role**: These points determine the position and orientation of the hyperplane
- **Significance**: Only these points affect the final model, making SVMs memory-efficient

#### SVM Visualization

The following plot shows an SVM decision boundary with support vectors highlighted:

![SVM Decision Boundary with Support Vectors](res/svm/svm_decision_boundary.png)

### The Dual Problem

The optimization problem can be solved using Lagrange multipliers, leading to the dual formulation:

Maximize: $W(\alpha) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n} \alpha_i \alpha_j y_i y_j (\mathbf{x_i} \cdot \mathbf{x_j})$

Subject to: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i y_i = 0$ and $0 \leq \alpha_i \leq C$

Where $\alpha_i$ are the Lagrange multipliers.

## <a name="svm-variants"></a>SVM Variants

### 1. C-SVM (Classification)

For classification tasks with a soft margin parameter $C$:

- Controls trade-off between smooth decision boundary and classifying training points correctly
- Higher $C$ values penalize misclassification more heavily

### 2. Nu-SVM (Classification)

Uses a parameter $\nu$ instead of $C$:

- $\nu$ represents the upper bound on the fraction of training errors
- Directly controls the number of support vectors

### 3. Epsilon-SVR (Regression)

For regression tasks with an epsilon-insensitive loss function:

- Only penalizes errors that exceed a threshold $\epsilon$
- Points within $\epsilon$ distance from the predicted value have no penalty

![Example of the Epsilon intensive loss function](https://eranraviv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Epsilon-insensitive_Loss.svg)

### 4. Nu-SVR (Regression)

Similar to Nu-SVM but for regression:

- Uses $\nu$ to control the number of support vectors and training errors
- Alternative to Epsilon-SVR

### SVM Variants Comparison Table

The following table summarizes the key differences between various SVM variants:

| Variant | Purpose | Key Parameter | Behavior |
|---------|---------|---------------|----------|
| **C-SVM** | Classification | C | Trade-off between margin size and misclassification |
| **Nu-SVM** | Classification | Nu | Directly controls fraction of support vectors |
| **Epsilon-SVR** | Regression | Epsilon | Tolerance for errors in regression |
| **Nu-SVR** | Regression | Nu | Directly controls fraction of support vectors in regression |

## <a name="kernel-methods"></a>Kernel Methods

### The Kernel Trick

The kernel trick allows SVMs to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly computing coordinates in that space. Common kernels include:

### 1. Linear Kernel

$K(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{x_j}) = \mathbf{x_i} \cdot \mathbf{x_j}$

- Equivalent to standard linear SVM
- Efficient for linearly separable data
- No additional parameters

### 2. Polynomial Kernel

$K(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{x_j}) = (\gamma \mathbf{x_i} \cdot \mathbf{x_j} + r)^d$

Where:

- $d$ is the degree of the polynomial
- $\gamma$ is the kernel coefficient
- $r$ is the independent term

### 3. RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel

$K(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{x_j}) = \exp(-\gamma ||\mathbf{x_i} - \mathbf{x_j}||^2)$

- Most popular kernel for non-linear problems
- $\gamma$ controls the influence of each training example
- Equivalent to an infinite-dimensional feature space

### 4. Sigmoid Kernel

$K(\mathbf{x_i}, \mathbf{x_j}) = \tanh(\gamma \mathbf{x_i} \cdot \mathbf{x_j} + r)$

- Similar to neural network activation function
- Sometimes equivalent to two-layer perceptron

### Kernel Selection Guidelines

| Data Type | Recommended Kernel | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| **Large # features, small # samples** | Linear | Less prone to overfitting |
| **Small # features, large # samples** | RBF or polynomial | Captures non-linear relationships |
| **High-dimensional sparse data** | Linear | Computationally efficient |
| **Text classification** | Linear | Works well with high-dimensional data |

## <a name="parameters-and-tuning"></a>Parameters and Tuning

### C Parameter (Regularization)

The C parameter in SVM controls the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a smooth decision boundary

| Parameter | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **High C** | Strong emphasis on correct classification of training points | Fits training data closely but risks overfitting |
| **Low C** | Emphasis on maximizing the margin between classes | Produces smoother decision boundary, may underfit |

Visualization of the effect of the different C parameter values on the SVM decision boundary:

![Effect of C Parameter on SVM Decision Boundary](res/svm/svm_c_parameter_effect.png)

### Gamma Parameter (Kernel Coefficient)

The gamma parameter controls how far the influence of a single training example reaches:

| Parameter | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **High Gamma** | Strong local influence from nearby training examples | Creates complex decision boundary, high risk of overfitting |
| **Low Gamma** | Broad influence extending to distant examples | Produces smoother decision boundary, better generalization |

The following plot illustrates the effect of different gamma values on the RBF kernel:

![Effect of Gamma Parameter on SVM Decision Boundary](res/svm/svm_gamma_parameter_effect.png)

### Degree Parameter (Polynomial Kernel)

The degree parameter $d$ controls the flexibility of the decision boundary:

| Parameter | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **High Degree** | Higher degree in polynomial kernel | Allows more complex, flexible decision boundaries, risk of overfitting |
| **Low Degree** | Lower degree in polynomial kernel | Results in simpler, smoother decision boundaries |

The following visualization demonstrates the effect of different polynomial degrees on the SVM decision boundary:

![Effect of Polynomial Degree Parameter on SVM Decision Boundary](res/svm/svm_polynomial_degree_effect.png)

### Parameter Interactions

The performance of SVMs depends not only on individual parameters but also on their interactions.
The combination of C and gamma parameters significantly affects model complexity:

| C Value | Gamma Value | Description | Potential Risk |
|---------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Low | Low | Creates a very simple model, allowing more misclassification in favor of a smoother decision boundary and broader generalization | Underfitting |
| Low | High | Prioritizes smooth decision boundary over accurate classification of individual points, with high sensitivity to individual points | Overfitting due to high sensitivity |
| High | Low | Strongly prioritizes accurate classification of individual points, but with lower sensitivity to each point | Underfitting if too rigid |
| High | High | Creates a very complex model, highly prioritizes accurately classifying individual points and is highly sensitive to each point | Overfitting |
| Balanced | Balanced | Typically results in good generalization performance | None |

Understanding these interactions is crucial for effective hyperparameter tuning.

The following visualization demonstrates how different combinations of C and gamma parameters affect model complexity:

### Parameter Tuning Strategies

1. **Grid search**: Systematically try different parameter combinations
2. **Cross-validation**: Use k-fold CV to evaluate performance on different subsets
3. **Start simple**: Begin with linear kernel and low parameter values
4. **Scale data**: Normalize features as SVMs are sensitive to feature scales
